Functions of a Bitcoin Node:
- Transaction and block validation
- Network relay and propagation
- Blockchain storage and serving
- Mempool management
- Consensus rule enforcement
- Network security enhancement
- Transaction and block filtering
- Network monitoring and statistics
- Optional wallet services

Reasons to Run Your Own Node:
- Financial sovereignty: Independent verification of blockchain data.
- Enhanced privacy: Hiding transactions within the larger blockchain.
- Network fortification: Increasing the network's decentralization and resilience.
- Educational value: Understanding Bitcoin's inner workings.
- Protocol influence: Participating in Bitcoin's governance.
- Embracing the Bitcoin ethos: "Don't trust, verify."

Requirements to Run a Node:
- Computer (even a Raspberry Pi or older machine)
- Hard drive (approximately 1 TB or more, preferably separate)
- Stable internet connection
- Download Bitcoin Core software from bitcoin.org or bitcoincore.org, verify the download, and install.
- Node Connection Types:
- Outgoing connections (required): Receiving data from other nodes.
- Incoming connections (recommended): Sharing data with other nodes, fully supporting the network. Requires router configuration (port 8333).
- Use bitnodes.io to check if your node is connected and sharing data.

Expect a lengthy download (around 600 GB) and verification process.
Includes wallet management, peer connection viewing, and a console for interacting with the node (e.g., `getblockchaininfo`, `getnetworkinfo`, `getnewaddress`).
Running a node actively supports the Bitcoin network and its decentralized nature.
