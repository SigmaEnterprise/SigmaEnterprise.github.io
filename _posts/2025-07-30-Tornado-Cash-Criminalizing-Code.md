## **Criminalizing Developers for Writing Code**

The U.S. government’s prosecution of Tornado Cash developers marks a dangerous turning point in the war on privacy. Instead of targeting those committing crimes, prosecutors are attempting to criminalize the very act of writing and publishing open-source software.  


- Authorities are framing Tornado Cash as a criminal enterprise, even though its developers had long since relinquished control. Its core purpose is *user financial privacy*, not money laundering.  
- Prosecutors misinterpreted quotes, inflated alleged amounts of “laundered” money, and mischaracterized Tornado Cash as a *money transmitter*—all to fit their narrative.  
- By using broad conspiracy charges, the government doesn’t need to prove the developer laundered money himself. Merely writing or promoting the code is enough to face prison.  
- Major banks routinely facilitate billions in illicit transactions but escape prosecution, while a single open-source developer is being crushed.

### **Why This Case Matters**

- Writing code is speech. Prosecutors are trying to equate publishing privacy-enhancing software with enabling crime, similar to banning the printing of books because criminals might read them.  
- Developers everywhere are watching. If Tornado Cash is criminalized, who will dare write privacy tools like VPNs, encryption libraries, or secure messaging apps?  
- This isn’t just about one protocol. Governments want total visibility into personal finances, reversing decades of implied financial privacy.

### **The Precedent We Can’t Afford**

A conviction would set a precedent that endangers the entire open-source ecosystem. Developers could be held criminally liable for how third parties use their software—even if they have zero control.  

This is about more than Tornado Cash:  
- Could **Bitcoin mixers** be next?  
- What about **privacy coins** or **P2P protocols**?  
- Could this spill over to **end-to-end encryption**, **Tor**, or **secure email clients**?

### **Closing Thoughts**

This case is not about stopping money laundering. It’s about **normalizing financial surveillance and punishing those who resist it**. If the government succeeds, the cost won’t just be a few privacy tools—it will be the loss of a fundamental human right.
