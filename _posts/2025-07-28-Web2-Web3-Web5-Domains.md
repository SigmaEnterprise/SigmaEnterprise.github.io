description: The Internet is changing fast, and so is the way we own and manage domain names. Traditional Web2 domains like `.com` and `.org` are still essential, but **Web3 and Web5 domains** are redefining what it means to have a truly secure, censorship-resistant digital presence.

**Web2 vs Web3 vs Web5 domains**, how they differ, and how you can start building your brand identity across all three layers today.

## **What Are Web2, Web3 & Web5 Domains?**

### **1. Web2 Domains – The Traditional Internet**

* Examples: `.com`, `.net`, `.org`, `.io`
* Managed by centralized registries (ICANN and accredited registrars)
* You rent them yearly, and ownership can be revoked or transferred by the registry
* Perfect for SEO, business websites, and email hosting

### **2. Web3 Domains – Blockchain-Powered Ownership**

* Examples: `.eth` (Ethereum Name Service), `.crypto` (Unstoppable Domains), `.btc` (Stacks), `.sol` (Solana)
* Purchased as NFTs; ownership is tied to your crypto wallet
* Resistant to censorship – nobody can “seize” your domain
* Can be used for **decentralized websites (IPFS, Arweave)**, **crypto wallet addresses**, and **dApp logins**

### **3. Web5 Domains – Decentralized Identity (DID)**

* Examples: `did:btc:xyz`, `did:ion:abc`
* These aren’t always traditional domains – they’re **self-sovereign identities**
* Built on Bitcoin and distributed identity layers like ION
* No renewal fees, no registry, full control of your digital identity
* Used for authentication, data vaults, and long-term identity across apps
