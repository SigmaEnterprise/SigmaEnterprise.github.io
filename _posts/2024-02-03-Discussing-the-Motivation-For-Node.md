The decision to run a Lightning Node,  is propelled by a myriad of personal motivations. Delving into the reasons that steer my involvement in running a node, the key drivers include:

1. **Personal Empowerment:** The desire to possess a personal, private node, firmly within my control.

2. **Autonomous Transaction Routing:** Enabling the capability to route my own transactions (txs) when spending sats through the Lightning Network (LN), liberating myself from dependence on other nodes' liquidity.

3. **Contributing to Network Health:** A commitment to aiding the broader network by strategically providing liquidity where it's needed the most, especially among small merchants operating their own nodes and requiring inbound liquidity.

4. **Fee Philosophy:** A conscious decision to eschew the pursuit of getting rich through routing fees. Instead, I deliberately set my channel fees at a remarkably affordable point.

5. **Supporting Novices:** A dedication to assisting newcomers  in navigating the intricate landscape of nodes, coupled with testing various applications using my node.

## Shaping the Lightning Network Landscape

The prevailing belief is that we are yet to witness the maturity of the fee market, making it premature to prioritize profits over building a robust payment network. The emphasis lies in fostering a strong foundation for payments within the network. The imposition of exorbitant fees and succumbing to greed can potentially inflict more harm than good. Some novices, engrossed in the pursuit of earning satoshis through routing, inadvertently mismanage scripts and tools, adversely impacting the broader network. Instances of disabling channels due to perceived lack of profitability emerge, a practice I find imprudent and contrary to the fundamental principles of the Lightning Network (LN).

## The Nodes in My Arsenal

Embarking on a journey through my node ecosystem, it's noteworthy that I operate an Start 9 node [Embassy]([Start9 Refurbished - HP EliteDesk 800 G3 | Start9 Store](https://store.start9.com/collections/servers/products/hp-elitedesk-800-g3-refurbished)) , deviating from the typical RaspPi setup to a more robust Elitedesk G3running DebianOS. This serves as my "public node," openly contributing to the network. Additionally, a discreet private node, shrouded in secrecy, complements my setup, reserved for highly confidential endeavors. The ensemble is further enriched by the inclusion of Blixt, a distinct node type seamlessly integrated into my mobile wallet, offering unparalleled companionship to my Umbrel node.

## Navigating the Lightning Landscape

In summary, my venture into running a Lightning Node is underpinned by a commitment to personal empowerment, network contribution, and the cultivation of a healthy fee philosophy. Steering clear of the race for routing fees, my focus remains on fortifying the network, aiding novices, and strategically managing liquidity. The diverse node setup, blending public and private facets, encapsulates my approach to maximizing the potential of the Lightning Network.
