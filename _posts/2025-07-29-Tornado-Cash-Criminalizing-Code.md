- The government falsely portrays Tornado Cash as a criminal enterprise, despite its developers having relinquished control over the protocol and its primary function being the protection of user financial privacy.
- The prosecution's case is riddled with inconsistencies and misinterpretations of evidence, including misreading a quote to inflate the amount of laundered money and incorrectly characterizing Tornado Cash as a money transmitter.
- The use of conspiracy charges allows the prosecution to circumvent proving direct involvement in money laundering, targeting the developer for simply creating and promoting the code, regardless of his lack of control over its use by third parties.
- The government's relentless pursuit of a software developer contrasts sharply with its lenient treatment of major financial institutions that facilitate far larger sums of illicit money laundering.
- The prosecution infringes on the developer's First Amendment rights, attempting to criminalize the creation and distribution of privacy-enhancing software, equating it to publishing a book or article.
- The case creates a chilling effect on developers, discouraging them from creating privacy tools for fear of prosecution, even if they are not directly involved in illegal activities.
- The government's actions are driven by a desire to maintain pervasive financial surveillance, not genuinely combatting money laundering. The real fear is losing the ability to monitor and control every financial transaction.
- The case represents a significant shift toward increased government control over personal finances, reversing decades of implicit financial privacy.
- A conviction would set a dangerous precedent, potentially criminalizing the development of numerous privacy tools, including VPNs and encryption software, impacting broader access to fundamental human rights.
