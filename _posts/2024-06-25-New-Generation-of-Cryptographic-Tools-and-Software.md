### Protocols

1. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**
   - **Overview:** Enable one party to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any additional information.
   - **Use Cases:** Privacy-preserving transactions, identity verification, secure voting.

2. **Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)**
   - **Overview:** Allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private.
   - **Use Cases:** Collaborative data analysis, joint financial transactions, secure auctions.

3. **Homomorphic Encryption**
   - **Overview:** Allows computations to be carried out on ciphertext, generating an encrypted result which, when decrypted, matches the result of operations performed on the plaintext.
   - **Use Cases:** Cloud computing, secure data outsourcing, encrypted search.

4. **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)**
   - **Overview:** Cryptographic algorithms that are believed to be secure against an attack by a quantum computer.
   - **Use Cases:** Future-proofing data security, secure communications, quantum-resistant digital signatures.

5. **Federated Learning**
   - **Overview:** A machine learning technique that trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging them.
   - **Use Cases:** Privacy-preserving AI, collaborative medical research, distributed model training.
